#Configuration file for '/etc/mpd.conf'
#After you've putted the information into the file
#you'll have to type in the terminal: sudo service mpd restart
#You may now listen from other computers/phones at the MPD servers address like this:
#http://0.0.0.0:8000/stream.mp3

#Note that on a Raspberry Pi PulseAudio isn't playing well.
